# Schema

# Example queries
All example queries are written in Trino SQL and are compatible with AWS Athena The syntax in your preferred SQL dialect may differ.

#### App categories ranked by unique user count
 <Code code="SELECT
  category,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS unique_user_count
FROM app_sessions
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY unique_user_count DESC" lang="js" />

#### App categories ranked by time spent
 <Code code="SELECT
  category,
  ROUND(SUM(duration) / (60.0 * 60.0)) AS time_spent_hours
FROM app_sessions
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY time_spent_hours DESC" lang="js" />

#### Top 5 apps by time spent per category and operating system
 
 <Code code="WITH apps AS (
    SELECT
      category,
      app_name,
      os_name,
      ROUND(SUM(duration) / (60.0 * 60.0)) as time_spent_hours,
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY category, os_name
      ORDER BY SUM(duration) DESC) AS rank
    FROM app_sessions
    GROUP BY
      category,
      app_name,
      os_name
  )
  SELECT * FROM apps
  WHERE rank <= 5
  ORDER BY category, os_name, rank" lang="js" />

# Key Performance Indicators
The following diagrams present the combined KPIs of across all Behavix Data Feeds. The KPIs are calculated from the sample data set that only contains active users. The active users definition in this data set is at least 7 active days in a month. If you are interested in different sampling criteria please contact sales.

For combined KPIs across all data feeds see [here](https://docs.behavix.io/datafeed/) .
